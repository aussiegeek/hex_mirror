# HexMirror

This is a small simple service to mirror hex.pm to the local disk.

It was written with [elixir.camp](http://elxiir.camp), where there is no internet connection, and so needs to be able to work completely offline.

## Instructions

1. Download it, setup deps and run
2. Wait. By default it will start mirroring automatically and save to `./tarballs` As of July 2016, this will fetch ~700MB of data

## TODO
* [ ] Mirror hex installer
* [ ] Configuration instructions
